ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§
This repository is currently being revisited. An update will be released in early September 2025.

Executive Summary
The interconnected crises of biodiversity collapse, climate change, and systemic health decline are a conservation challenge. Conservation technology like camera traps, drones, eDNA, and passive acoustic monitoring are critical tools for conservationists to monitor the impacts of conservation interventions on biodiversity. The R programming environment is widely used by ecologists and conservationists
